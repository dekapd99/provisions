# Dotfile to be used as the main source of everything in my dotfiles configuration. It ties up everything,
# bootstraps stuff, and loads them to shell once ready. You can say that this is the 'driver code' or
# the main function of a program if that makes it easier to understand.
#
# Compatible with: `bash`, `sh`, and `zsh` terminals. Tested OSes are MacOS, Debian, and Ubuntu.
# Other terminals (fish) should be supported, but is untested yet. Other OSes should be supported,
# as long as it is *nix based.
#
# The default path for the `provisions` repository is `~/Projects/provisions`. It is intentional and subjective, but
# I like having everything in an ordered fashion. Aliases, functions and the like will be sorted alphabetically for
# ease of reading.
